# My First API
This is a simple API created using DRF. My goal was to learn following concepts and tools by using: 
- DRF
- Nested Routes
- Djagno Admin Page
- Filters
- Creating fully customized user model by inheriting `AbstractBaseUser`
- authorization using *Djoser* and *djangorestframework_simplejwt*
